      <h1>Work Or School Exams</h1>
      <p>
        At Honeygo Pediatrics, we can take care of your childs' work or school
        physicals. These are crucial because they insure your loved one stays in
        good health, as well as protecting those around them. Every child,
        teenager, or young adult should receive a physical examination before
        starting school or even a new job. A typical physical exam includes
        gethering medical history, observing and evaluating posture, mobility,
        joints and organs, as well as vision and hearing tests. There are many
        good reasons for an individual to have a medical examination prior to
        attending school or work. All involve protecting individual children and
        their classmates.
      </p>
      <p>During a school or work physical, we evaluate the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Height and weight</li>
        <li>Pulse and blood pressure</li>
        <li>Posture, mobility, muscle strength</li>
        <li>Ears, nose and throat</li>
        <li>Vision and hearing via tests</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Travel Exams</h1>
      <p>
        The best time to make an appointment for a travel exam is at least 4-6
        weeks before your trip. Recommendations for vaccines or medications
        depend on many different factors that are specific to each person. This
        includes where you are traveling, the length of your trip, any
        activities you may do, and additional personal factors such as age,
        medical and immunization history, as well as one's current medical
        state. We will provide the best advice depending on your child's
        situation. If your child was recently sick or if they find themselves
        sick at the time of planned travel, be sure to notify us. Traveling
        while they are sick may put their health at risk or put others around
        them at risk for getting sick.
